    <p>Good Day My Fellow Distinguished Engineers,</p>
    <p>I am Sule Solace Adamu, a fourth year Computer Engineering student and I am using this medium to officially for your support to be the next Director Of Socials of our amiable Faculty organization, the Nigerian Universities Engineering Students' Association (NUESA), University Of Maiduguri Chapter. I would like to be the social director because I believe social events are very important aspects of our society where a range of different people with both similar and different interests meet to exchange ideas. I have vast relevant experience and skills at organizing social events and a good knowledge about this job. My main ambitions if I got this position would be:</p>

    <p>1.) To build good relationships between students of the different departments and the executives with other students and organization in order to be able to put on a range of different events.</p>

    <p>2.) To organize activities, workshops, trivia and tutorials aligned with the current trends in our respective Engineering fields.</p>

    <p>3.) To host events that are in synchrony with laid down standards of the University community.</p>

    <p>4.) To engage other student bodies in organizing joint events in order to meet new people and socialize.</p>

    <p>5.) Ultimately, I want to make the next session an enjoyable one for all engineering students.</p>

    <p>If elected, I will be YOUR social director and my work will be directed by you all, Thank you.</p>
